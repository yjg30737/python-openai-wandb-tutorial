## Result

The answer generated by GPT-3 will be printed.

The question in this script is

`Correct this to standard English:\n\nShe no went to the market.`

The answer is

`She didn't go to the market.`

WanDB makes a bunch of files such as log in the project directory.

You can see the tables and graph of the statistics of this in your wandb profile page as well.

## Note
This is using the <a href="https://beta.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3">text-davinci-003</a> model at GPT-3 which is latest one at this moment(2023-01-08).

This is the most accurate one, and also the slowest.

You have to install certain version of wandb(0.13.4) since <a href="https://github.com/wandb/wandb/issues/4583">this error</a> occurs.
